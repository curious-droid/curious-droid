My top 5 most salient lines of code:
- ```#include <iostream>```
- ```#define int long long```
- ```signed main() {...}```
- ```for (auto it = ranges.lower_bound({{l, 0}, 0}); it != ranges.end() && (*it).first.first <= r; it = ranges.erase(it))```
- ```std::cout << ((((dp[N][0][0] + dp[N][0][1]) % MOD - dp[N][1][1] + MOD) % MOD - dp[N][1][0] + MOD) % MOD + MOD) % MOD << "\n";```
